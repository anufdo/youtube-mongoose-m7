In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into Mongoose and explore how to use Instance Methods, Statics, and Query Helpers to make our data models more powerful and flexible. We'll start by defining a basic Mongoose schema, then we'll explore how to define and use Instance Methods for data manipulation and formatting. Next, we'll cover how to define and use Statics Methods for querying and data manipulation. Finally, we'll explore how to define and use Query Helpers to extend the query builder's API and make it easier to build complex queries on our data.
